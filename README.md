###### Abstract
The capability to collect and store digital information by statistical agencies, governments or individuals has created huge opportunities to analyze and build knowledge-based models. With the rise of Internet many services and companies have exploited these opportunities collecting huge amounts of data, which most of the cases are considered confidential. This causes the need to develop methods that allow the dissemination of confidential data for data mining purposes while preserving individuals' private information.  Thus, personal data could be collected, transferred or sold to third parties ensuring the individuals' confidentiality, but still being statistically useful.  Internet is full of unstructured textual data like posts or documents with a large content of information that can be extracted and analyzed. Documents are especially difficult to protect due to their lack of structure. In this thesis we distinguish two different models to protect documents. On the one hand, we consider the protection of a collection of documents, so this set of documents can be analyzed by means of text mining and machine learning techniques. On the other hand, we consider the protection of single documents by means of the documents' sanitization. This is the process of detecting and removing the parts of the text considered sensitive.  When dealing with governmental classified information, sanitization attempts to reduce the sensitiveness of the document, possibly yielding a non-classified document. In this way, governments show they uphold the freedom of information while the national security is not jeopardised.  This thesis presents a set of different methods and experiments for the protection of unstructured textual data protection and besides, it introduces an advanced method to evaluate the security of microdata protection methods.  The main contributions are: 

* The development of a new semi-automatic method to assist documents' declassification.
* The definition of two specific metrics for evaluating the information loss and disclosure risk of sanitized documents.
* The development of two cluster-based approaches based on the k-anonymity principle to anonymize vector space models. One exploits the sparsity and the other exploits the possible semantic relations of those vectors.
* The study of advanced methods to evaluate the disclosure risk of microdata protection methods. In particular, we have developed a general supervised metric learning approach for distance-based record linkage. Moreover, we have reviewed the suitability of a set of parameterized distance functions that can be used together with the supervised approach.
